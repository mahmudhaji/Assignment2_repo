    Coffee is brewed 
    drink with a distinct aroma and flavor, prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds found 
    inside "barriers" of the coffee plant. Coffee plants are cultivated in over 70 countries, primarily 
    in equatorial latin America, Southest Asia, India and Africa. The two most commonly grown are 
    the highly regarded Arabica, and the less Sophisticated but stronger and more hardy robusta. 
    The latter is resistant to the coffee leaf rust, Hemileiya vastatrix, but has a more bitter taste. Once 
    ripe, coffee beans are picked, processed, and dried. Green(Unroasted) coffee beans are one of the 
    most traded agricultural commodities in the world. Once traded, the beans are roasted to varying 
    degrees, depending on the desired flavor, before being ground and brewed to create coffee. 
    Coffee is slightly acidic and can have a stimulating effect on humans because of its caffeine 
    contents its one of the most popular drinks in the world. It can be prepared and presented in a 
    variety of ways, the effect of coffee on human health has been a subject of many studies; 
    however, result have varied in terms of coffee's relative benefits. The majority of recent research 
    suggest that moderate coffee consumption is benign or mildly beneficial in healthy adults. 
    However, the diterpenes in coffee may increase the risk of heart disease.
